The interactive d3 graph above displays Hermès’ Annual Revenue by 4 regions globally from year 2010 to 2020. By clicking on each year button, readers are able to explore geographical distributions of revenue by year. While the total revenue are increasing year by year from 2010 to 2019, we observe a slight decrease in year 2020 due to the pandemic. More interestingly, even though the total revenue decreased in 2020, revenue in Asia-pacific increased quite bit which also compensated other region’s decrease. It seems that Hermès’ sales in Asia-pacific was not effected by the pandemic as heavily as other regions last year.<br>
