## Introduction

Our project is about to introduce the Herm√®s brand performance during 2020 and compare the performance with other brands or its own performance in the more distant past. Our goal is to explore deep into the brand operation principle and discuss the impact of the pandemic on the revenue of the company. We hope our plots can provide some prospectives that people never think of or pay attention with, and demonstrates some interesting facts. Hope everyone can enjoy the readings.
