[["index.html", "Hermès 2020 Performance Analysis Chapter 1 Introduction", " Hermès 2020 Performance Analysis Jen Wang, Wenjie Wei and Yinqiu Feng 2021-04-11 Chapter 1 Introduction Hermès, a renowned French luxury goods manufacturer established in 1837, specializes in leather goods, fine jewelry, clothes, home furniture, and lifestyle accessories. Interestingly, Hermès is where you can’t even walk into a boutique and buy a bag with a five figure price immediately. You can’t buy almost all the handbags in iconic styles online neither. They only sell iconic bags such as Birkin, Kelly and Constance to customers who have been established a extensive purchase history and each customer can only purchase one iconic bag in every six months. This famous “Anti Marketing” strategy which focuses on exclusivity, scarcity and craftsmanship was very successful in the past decades. While so many retails stores were heavily affected by the unprecedented health and economic crisis in year 2020, we are interested to explore whether this leading luxury brand still outperformed and demonstrated its business strategy strength, ability to adapt and the agility. In this project, we would like to evaluate Hermès’ performance in 2020 by exploring its regional performance, sectoral performance and retail stores growth, analyzing its financial statements (income statement and balance sheet), and stock information. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources We obtained the data mainly from Hermès Finance Website. Since our primary focus was how an unprecedented health and economic crisis in 2020 effect Hermès performance, we pays more attention on comparing Hermès’ data in 2019 and in 2020. From Hermès’ Annual Reports and Quarterly Reports, we were able to gather Hermès’ Revenue Analysis, Store Allocation as well as Financial Statements: 1. Revenue by Geographical Area Quarterly and annually revenue analysis by geographical area in fiscal year 2019 and 2020 divide the total revenue into Europe(France and the rest of Europe), Asia(Japan and the rest of Asia), Americas and Other. 2. Store Allocation We crapped global Hermès store allocation data from 2020 Universal Document. Since our focus is on Hermès’ performance in 2020, we also collected data of new stores that was opened in year 2020. 3. Revenue by Sector Quarterly and annually revenue analysis by sector in fiscal year 2019 and 2020 divide the total revenue into seven business sectors: Leather Goods and Saddlery, Ready-to-Wear and Accessories, Silk and Textiles, Other Hermès sectors (Jewelry and home products), Perfumes, Watches as well as Other products (Sub-brand products). As we all know Hermès focuses on exclusivity, scarcity, craftsmanship with it’s renowned “Anti Marketing” strategy, customers are required to establish a solid purchase history before getting a Hermès handbag (Birkin, Kelly, Constance and etc.). Revenue by sector analysis gives us a sense of how much an average customer need to spend in Hermès’ non leather goods in order to get a Hermès bag. 4. Key Figures The Key Figures table in Hermès’ quarterly and annually reports include important variables that illustrate Hermès’ performance such as recurring operating income, number of employees, equity and etc. We would like to see if there is any variable shows interesting pattern from 2019 to 2020. 5. 2019 &amp; 2020 Financial Statements Financial Statements contains valuable information about a company’s performance. We obtained Hermès’ Income Statement and Balance Sheet in year 2019 and 2020 from Hermès annual reports. 6. Stock Information We would like to see how did Hermès’ stock prices perform comparing to other relative stock prices such as stock market index and relative French based luxury goods corporations’ stock. We obtained French Stock Index, S&amp;P 500, LVMH(owns LV, Loewe, Dior etc.) stock and Kering(owns Gucci, Balenciaga, YSL and etc.) stock using quantmod package in R. One issue we faced when collecting data was that all data available was in pdf format. We managed to solve this problem by data scrapping using pdftools package. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 d3 data", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 d3 data 1. Revenue by Geographical Area Eliminate total and subtotal revenue of area and keep all revenues value of smallest region unit in numeric type. And convert wide data to long data by using tidy verse. After preprocessing all quarters data, concatenate all quarter’s data with which quarter specified. 2. Store Allocation To be compatible with the region name in the maps package, we change the country name of United Kingdoms and Monaco. And We also include the caribbean in Americas, Hong Kong and Macao in China to match the boundary in package. 3. Revenue by Sector Convert all revenues value to numeric type and eliminate total and subtotal revenue of sectors. Also rename sectors name by eliminating footnote. Then convert wide data to long data by using tidy verse. After preprocessing all quarters data, concatenate all quarter’s data with which quarter specified. 4. Key Figures First, we select the important variables that we want to discuss in key figures. Then we transfer the row name into date column. Because these metrics all have different units, and it will be meaningless to put them together in one plot, we decide to transfer all values into index in a way it can provide a better comparison. 5. 2019 &amp; 2020 Financial Statements For income statement, we only extract the expense, income, and final net profit. Since we would like to show the flow of revenue and compare the final profit between 2020 and 2019, we eliminate the subtotal. Also rename the name of income and expense could fit axis better and add a column of reference for waterfall plot. For balance Sheet, we combine the asset data from 2018 to 2020 together as the liability data from 2018 to 2020. Then we only include the major terms in balance sheet and merge the asset with liabilities. We transform the data frame into a better frame for plotting and replace the ‘,’ inside amount column. Hence, we can easily transfer the data type of value from character to numeric. 6. Stock Information Convert the date column into Date data type. Join all different stocks data together.Then, we can calculate the return rate by calculate the difference of prices between \\(Day_t\\) and \\(Day_{t+1}\\) and divide by the \\(Price_t\\). We assume the first day return to be 0.

From 2019’s total revenue, we find people tend to spend lesser on quarter 1 and quarter 2 than rest quarter. It also happened on 2020. However thre ratio of first two quarter to last two quarter decrease tremendously. Therefore we can infer that the decreases on fiset two quarter influenced by Covid-19 which started at 2020. And we also knew that the customer’s purchase recovery since third quarter and even larger that third and fourth quarter in 2019. ## NULL we plot a treemap on Revenue on both 2019 and 2020 where each smaller rectangle represents the revenue ratio of certain region of one quarter in 2019 and 2020. From the graoh, we can find that the total revenue of 2020 is slightly smaller than 2019 and compared with 2019, first two quarter, especially second quarter, have lesser revenue than usual. From the prespective, Asia except Japan takes largest potion of total revenue in every quarter and has been influened smaller during first two quarter in 2020. Since the size of Asia except Japan at 2020 first two quarter is similiar as that at 2019 first two quarter and the size of Asia except Japan at 2020 last two quarter is larger than that at 2019 last two quarter. Their consupmtion might be the main reason for increase on last quarter on 2020. ## NULL In order to figure out which sector of Hermes product makes higher revenue and if the Covid influences any of sectors, we plot a treemap on Revenue on both 2019 and 2020 where each smaller rectangle represents the revenue ratio of certain sector of one quarter in 2019 and 2020. The reason we also divided data by quarter is that we want to eliminate the quarterly change of people spending on different sector. Looking at the sectors, Leather good and Saddlery is the main revenue amoung all the sector and Cloth is the second largest source of revenue. The portion of each sector’s revenue maintains in a relative steady status which did not influenced by Covid-19 period. By inspecting into the stack bar chart, we can verified the information from treemap that the revenue of first two quarter in 2020 decreases tremendously compared to the revenue of first two quarter in 2019, expecially second quarter. And the revenue percentage of each sector is relative stable except we found on bar chart that silk took lesser portion in 2020 second quarter and leather good took higher portion at that time. From revenue of Hermes before, during and after Covid, we can get little insight about the treasure of upper class. Since Hermes is the extreme luxury brand which mainly purchase by upper class. It seems like the Covid-19 only restrict the purchase of upper class during Covid-19 which might cause by the inconvinence of clousure. Since the revenues increases after covid-19 exposure period and made up at third quarter and forth quarter. The upper class in Asia got smallest negative effect. And we also know that the portion of each sector keeps a constant ratio and the ratio did not changed by quarter and Covid. This plot idea comes from this website. Here is the income statement of Hermes in 2019 and 2020. In 2019, the total Revenue of Hermes is 6900 millions of eu whereas the total Revenue in 2020 is 6400 millions of eu. And the net income of Hermes in 2019 is 1500 millions of eu whereas net income of Hermes in 2020 is 1380 millions of eu. From the overal income statement we can know that two main cost of Hermes are sales expense and S&amp;A expense (Selling, marketing and administrative expenses). During 2020, Hermes shrinks their Selling, marketing and administrative expenses from 2940 to 2670 and reduce a little bit sales expense which are not influenced by closure during Covid 5.1 key figure time series(Wendy) This plot shows the trend of the Hermes performance from some perspectives in Years 2016 to 2020. It is very clear that there is an upward trend for both Revenue and Recurring operating income before 2020. However, we can also mention that there is a sudden drop from in 2020 for these two factors because of Covid-19. In the meantime, the workforce keeps the upward trending all the time. It might reflects the confident expectation of the company 5.2 Balance sheet T map(Wendy) This plot idea comes from this GitHub repo In plot above, there is a gradual increase for both asset and liabilities when year passed. The huge increase on stockholder equity should be attributed to the increase of assets. Owners’ equity, referred to as shareholders’ equity, is the amount of money initially invested into the company plus any retained earnings, and it represents a source of funding for the business. And it is the difference between total asset and liability. Therefore we can see the balance between asset and liability. We can easily get access to the total for both sides on bottom of the plot. One thing that catch our attention should be the decrease of current liabilities in year 2020, which is a good sign of the brand performance. Since the assets increased in 2020, the drop of current liabilities may provide more benefits to the shareholders. 5.3 Stock Time Series in March This interactive time series plot can provide the chance to see the data value on each date. You can either put the cursor on the point you would like to know or drag a specific time range that you want to observe. From above time series, we can discuss the pandemic impact on Hermes and worldwide stock market. We could observe that the impact on the other major luxury brands’ stock return was much more ferocious than the impact on the Hermes one. Also, as the Hermes stock is only traded in French stock market, we should expect it has similar fluctuation with the CAC40 (the french stock index). Among all the french stock including the index, it took the minimal tumble on the March 11th, which was the time the world wide stock market took a sharp tumble. I also include the S&amp;P500 index in the plot as the marker of global stock market. ## Hermes Stock time series vs French Index in 2020 To give a more comprehensive understanding, here I attached with the time series of both Hermes and CAC40 on the entire 2020 year. If you want to track the time series in a specific time range, please drag the button on the plot under the time series. You can easily set the bound of time by drag the right button and the left one. From the entire year time series, we could also observe that the hermes return rate fluctuated with in a narrower range during most of the time. In a more straightforward way, the HERMES stock was more steady, as comparing to other stocks in French stock market. See this plot from R gallery:https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/318-custom-dygraphs-time-series-example.html 5.4 Store Info This map is designed to give a better interpretation of Hermes store distribution around the world. You can click any region you want to know and zoom in to take a more clear look at the data. You can also put the cursor on the location, it show all the data about that location. All purple points indicate the regions that have new stores open in 2020. From the map, we find that USA, Japan and China are the regions that have the most stores (each has more than 35 stores). This might be one of the reasons that the sale of Hermes mainly comes from America and Asia Pacific. One interesting thing that France, as the home country the Hermes brand is based in, has 29 stores, which is less than the top 3 regions we discussed before. This might reflects that the purchasing power attracts the brand more than anything else. Also, we can discover that there are still lots of regions that Hermes has not stepped on. The number of Hermes stores reflects the economy or the size of millionaires in the specific country, which is consistent with the luxury brand of nature. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component The interactive d3 graph above displays Hermès’ Annual Revenue by 4 regions globally from year 2010 to 2020. By clicking on each year button, readers are able to explore geographical distributions of revenue by year. While the total revenue are increasing year by year from 2010 to 2019, we observe a slight decrease in year 2020 due to the pandemic. More interestingly, even though the total revenue decreased in 2020, revenue in Asia-pacific increased quite bit which also compensated other region’s decrease. It seems that Hermès’ sales in Asia-pacific was not effected by the pandemic as heavily as other regions last year. (Here is a related news about Hermès in Asia-pacific after coronavirus lockdown) "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion In order to evaluate the performance of Hermès during pandemic, we analyzed the revenue by different factors, financial statement, key figure and stock price. By comparing the revenue geographically of Hermès in 2019 with that in 2020, we can get the conclusion that the Covid-19 have been negatively influenced revenue from all area except Asian at the first half year and recovered gradually at the last quarter year. The revenue from Asian has not been influenced at all and increase. The main consumer from Asian might be from China by looking at the stare global distribution where there are highest stores’ density in China. However, the growth of revenue in Asian does not make up the loss in other regions. In 2020 year, Hermès decreases 500 million EU compared with revenue in 2019. By saving in Selling, marketing and administrative expenses, they diminish this loss to 300 millions EU, final profit from 1500 millions EU to 1300 millions EU. However, those negative influence on revenues does not affect consumer’s passion to Hermès’s leather product which takes nearly half of revenue of Hermès. Although the Revenue and Recurring operating decrease and back to 2018 level, the workforce of company is keeping same increase rate which represent the growth of Hermès company is not affected by Covid-19. Also, we can check that the total asset of Hermès increased as well, and the stockholder equality increase as well. And the stockholder also shows large market confidence on Hermès. During pandemic period, although the stock price of Hermès fluctuates with market, it still shows relative static compared with other luxury stock. From overall, although Hermès’s revenue has been impacted by Covid-19, their customers’ loyalty shows great confidence in the future. The group remains highly committed and active, and gradually adapts measures to those taken by health and public authorities. "]]
