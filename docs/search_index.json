[["index.html", "Hermès 2020 Performance Analysis Chapter 1 Introduction", " Hermès 2020 Performance Analysis Jen Wang, Wenjie Wei and Yinqiu Feng 2021-04-12 Chapter 1 Introduction Hermès, a renowned French luxury goods manufacturer established in 1837, specializes in leather goods, fine jewelry, clothes, home furniture, and lifestyle accessories. Interestingly, Hermès is where you can’t even walk into a boutique and buy a bag with a five figure price immediately. You can’t buy almost all the handbags in iconic styles online neither. They only sell iconic bags such as Birkin, Kelly and Constance to customers who have been established a extensive purchase history and each customer can only purchase one iconic bag in every six months. This famous “Anti Marketing” strategy which focuses on exclusivity, scarcity and craftsmanship was very successful in the past decades. While so many retails stores were heavily affected by the unprecedented health and economic crisis in year 2020, we are interested to explore whether this leading luxury brand still outperformed and demonstrated its business strategy strength, ability to adapt and the agility. In this project, we would like to evaluate Hermès’ performance in 2020 by exploring its regional performance, sectoral performance and retail stores growth, analyzing its financial statements(income statement and balance sheet), and stock information. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources We obtained the data mainly from Hermès Finance Website. Since our primary focus was how an unprecedented health and economic crisis in 2020 effect Hermès performance, we pays more attention on comparing Hermès’ data in 2019 and in 2020. From Hermès’ Annual Reports and Quarterly Reports, we were able to gather Hermès’ Revenue Analysis, Store Allocation as well as Financial Statements: 1. Revenue by Geographical Area Quarterly and annually revenue analysis by geographical area in fiscal year 2019 and 2020 divide the total revenue into Europe(France and the rest of Europe), Asia(Japan and the rest of Asia), Americas and Other. 2. Store Allocation We crapped global Hermès store allocation data from 2020 Universal Document. Since our focus is on Hermès’ performance in 2020, we also collected data of new stores that was opened in year 2020. 3. Revenue by Sector Quarterly and annually revenue analysis by sector in fiscal year 2019 and 2020 divide the total revenue into seven business sectors: Leather Goods and Saddlery, Ready-to-Wear and Accessories, Silk and Textiles, Other Hermès sectors (Jewelry and home products), Perfumes, Watches as well as Other products (Sub-brand products). As we all know Hermès focuses on exclusivity, scarcity, craftsmanship with it’s renowned “Anti Marketing” strategy, customers are required to establish a solid purchase history before getting a Hermès handbag (Birkin, Kelly, Constance and etc.). Revenue by sector analysis gives us a sense of how much an average customer need to spend in Hermès’ non leather goods in order to get a Hermès bag. 4. Key Figures The Key Figures table in Hermès’ quarterly and annually reports include important variables that illustrate Hermès’ performance such as recurring operating income, number of employees, equity and etc. We would like to see if there is any variable shows interesting pattern from 2019 to 2020. 5. 2019 &amp; 2020 Financial Statements Financial Statements contains valuable information about a company’s performance. We obtained Hermès’ Income Statements and Balance Sheets in year 2019 and 2020 from Hermès annual reports. 6. Stock Information We would like to see how did Hermès’ stock price perform comparing to other relative stock prices such as stock market index and relative French based luxury goods corporations’ stocks. We obtained French Stock Index, S&amp;P 500, LVMH(owns LV, Loewe, Dior etc.) stock and Kering(owns Gucci, Balenciaga, YSL and etc.) stock using quantmod package in R. One issue we faced when collecting data was that all data available was in pdf format. We managed to solve this problem by data scrapping using pdftools package. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 1. Revenue by Geographical Area Eliminated total and subtotal revenue of area and kept all revenues value of smallest region unit in numeric type. And converted wide data to long data by using tidyverse package. After preprocessing all quarters’ data, we concatenated all quarters’ data with each quarter specified. 2. Store Allocation To be compatible with the region name in the maps package, we converted the country names of United Kingdoms and Principality of Monaco to their abbreviation. And we also included the Caribbean in Americas, Hong Kong and Macao in China to match the boundary in packages. 3. Revenue by Sector Converted all revenue to numeric type and eliminated total and subtotal revenue of sectors. Also renamed sectors’ name by eliminating footnotes. Then we converted wide data to long data by using tidyverse package. After preprocessing all quarters’ data, we concatenated all quarters’ data with each quarter specified. 4. Key Figures First, we selected important variables that we want to discuss in key figures. Then we transferred the rownames into date column. Since these metrics all have different units, and it would be meaningless to put them together in one plot, we decided to transfer all values into index in a way it can provide a better comparison. 5. 2019 &amp; 2020 Financial Statements For income statements, we extracted the expenses, income, and final net profits. Since we would like to show the flow of revenue and compare the final profit between 2020 and 2019, we eliminated the intermediate incomes. We also converted income and expenses to their abbreviation so that they could fit x-axis better in the waterfall plot. For balance Sheets, we combined the asset data as well as the liability data together from 2018 to 2020. Then we included the major terms in balance sheet and merged the assets with liabilities. We transformed the dataframe into a better form for plotting and removed the ‘,’ inside amount column so that we could easily transfer the data type from character to numeric. 6. Stock Information Converted the Date column into Date data type. Joined all different stocks data together so that we could calculate the return rate by calculaing the differences of prices between \\(Day_t\\) and \\(Day_{t+1}\\) and dividing the differences by \\(Price_t\\)(We assumed the first day return to be 0). 7. 2010-2020 Revenue vy Geographical Area(d3 data) Introduced Year column as rownames and use it for d3 graph. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Luckily, all of our data do not contain any missing values. Therefore we did not encounter any problem with it. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Revenue by Geographical Area 5.2 Revenue by Sector 5.3 Key Figures Time Series Plot 5.4 Financial Statements 5.5 Stock Information", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Revenue by Geographical Area 5.1.1 Revenue by Region By inspecting the proportions of two years’ revenue in the treemap below, we could see that the total revenue in 2020 is slightly less than that of 2019. From 2019’s total revenue, we found people tend to spend less on the first and second quarter comparing to the rest of the year. The same pattern also appeared in 2020. However the proportion of first two quarters is much smaller in 2020. Therefore we could infer that the decreases on first two quarters were influenced by Covid-19 outbreak in early 2020. We could tell from the map that Hermès’ sales bounced back in the third and fourth quarter in 2020 possibly because of the recovery of covid-19 in Asia and emergence of the e-commerce. we plotted the treemap above on Revenue in 2019 and 2020 where each smaller rectangle represents the revenue proportion of a specified region in a single quarter. By inspecting this graph, it is evident that Asia took the largest potion of total revenue in every quarter and its revenue was less impacted by the covid-19 outbreak in the first two quarter in 2020. Since the size of Asia at 2020 first two quarter is similar as that at 2019 first two quarter and the size of Asia except Japan at 2020 last two quarter is larger than that at 2019 last two quarter. Their consumption might be the main reason for increase on last quarter on 2020. 5.1.2 Store Allocation This map is designed to give a better interpretation of Hermès store distribution around the world. You can click any region you want to know and zoom in to take a more clear look at the data. You can also put the cursor on the location, it will show all the data about that location. All purple points indicate the regions that had new stores opened in 2020. From the map, we found that USA, Japan and China are the regions that have the most stores(each has more than 35 stores). This might be one of the reasons that the sale of Hermes mainly comes from America and Asia Pacific. One interesting finding is that France, as the home country Hermès brand is based in, has only 29 stores, which is less than the top 3 regions we discussed before. This might reflects that the purchasing power attracts the brand more than anything else. Also, we can discover that there are still lots of regions that Hermes has not stepped on. The number of Hermes stores reflects the economy or the size of millionaires in the specific country, which is consistent with the luxury brand of nature. 5.2 Revenue by Sector 5.2.1 Revenue by Sector Treemap In order to figure out which sectors of Hermes product makes the most revenue and whether the Covid-19 influenced any of sectors, we plotted a treemap on Revenue in both 2019 and 2020 where each smaller rectangle represents the revenue proportion of certain sector in a single quarter in 2019 and 2020. The reason we divided data by quarter is that we wanted to eliminate the seasonal effects of people consumption on different sectors. Looking into the sectors, Leather good and Saddlery is the main revenue among all the sectors and Clothes is the second largest source of revenue. The portion of each sector’s revenue maintains in a relatively steady status which was not influenced by Covid-19. 5.2.2 Revenue by Sector Stacked Bar Chart By inspecting into the stacked bar chart, we confirmed our findings from the treemap that the revenue of the first two quarters in 2020 decreased tremendously compared to that of the first two quarters in 2019, especially in the second quarter in 2020. The revenue percentage of each sector is relative stable except that the Silk and Textiles took less portion in the second quarter and Leather Good took higher portion at that time in 2020. By inpecting the pattern of Hermès’ revenue before and after the covid-19 outbreak, we could get a insight about the purchasing power of the upper class. Since Hermes is a extreme luxury brand which was mainly purchased by people from upper class. It looks like that the covid-19 only restricted the purchase of upper class during the lockdown period which might be caused by the inconvenience of store closures. Since the revenue recovered after covid-19 outbreak period and made up at third quarter and forth quarter. 5.3 Key Figures Time Series Plot This plot shows the trend of the Hermès performance in some perspectives from year 2016 to 2020. It is very clear that there is an constant upward trend for both Revenue and Recurring operating income before 2020 but a sudden drop in 2020 because of the pandemic. In the meantime, the workforce keeps the upward trending even in 2020. It might reflects the confident expectation of the company. 5.4 Financial Statements 5.4.1 Hermès Income Statements This plot idea comes from this website. Here is the income statements of Hermès in 2019 and 2020. In 2019, the total Revenue of Hermès was 6900 millions of Euros whereas the total Revenue in 2020 was 6400 millions of Euros. Hermès also cutted expenses in 2020 by 300 millions of Euros. The net income of Hermès in 2019 was 1500 millions of Euros whereas net income of Hermès in 2020 was 1380 millions of Euros. From the waterfall plots of income statements above, we can see that two main costs of Hermès are Cost of Sales and S&amp;A Expenses(Selling, marketing and administrative expenses). During 2020, Hermès shrank its selling, marketing and administrative expenses from 2940 millions of Euros to 2670 millions of Euros and reduced sales expenses a little bit which were not influenced heavily by the tsore closures during the covid-19. 5.4.2 Hermès Balance Sheet T-account map This plot idea comes from this GitHub repo. In the plot above, there is a gradual increase for both assets and liabilities by years. The huge increase on stockholder equity should be attributed to the increase of assets. Owners’ equity, referred to as shareholders’ equity, is the amount of money initially invested into the company plus any retained earnings, and it represents a source of funding for the business. And it is the difference between total asset and liability. We can easily get access to the total for both sides on bottom of the plot. One thing that caught our attention was the decrease of current liabilities in year 2020, which is a good sign of the brand performance. Since the assets increased in 2020, the drop of current liabilities may provide more benefits to the shareholders. 5.5 Stock Information 5.5.1 Stock Time Series Plot in March This interactive time series plot can provide the chance to see the data value on each date. You can either put the cursor on the point you would like to know or drag a specific time range that you want to observe. From above time series, we can discuss the pandemic impacts on Hermès and worldwide stock market. We could observe that the impact on the other major luxury brands’ stock return was much more ferocious than the impact on the Hermès one. Also, since Hermès stock can only be traded in French stock market, we should expect it has similar fluctuations with the CAC40 (the french stock index). Among all the french stock including the index, Hermès took the minimal tumble on the March 11th, which was the time the world wide stock market took a sharp tumble. I also included the S&amp;P500 index in the plot as the marker of global stock market. ### Hermès Stock vs French Index in 2020 This plot idea comes from R gallery. To give a more comprehensive understanding, here I attached the time series of both Hermès stock return and CAC40 on the entire year 2020. If you want to track the time series in a specific time range, please drag the button on the plot under the time series. You can easily set the bound of time by dragging the left and right button displayed at the bottom of the plot. From the entire year time series plot, we could also observe that the Hermès’ return rate fluctuated within a narrower range during the most of the time. In a more straightforward way, Hermès stock was more steady, as comparing to other stocks in French stock market. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component The interactive d3 graph above displays Hermès’ Annual Revenue by 4 regions globally from year 2010 to 2020. By clicking on each year button, readers are able to explore geographical distributions of revenue by year. While the total revenue was increasing year by year from 2010 to 2019, we observed a slight decrease in year 2020 due to the pandemic. More interestingly, the total revenue decreased only by a small percentage in 2020 since the revenue in Asia-pacific increased quite a bit which also compensated other region’s decreases. It seems that Hermès’ sales in Asia-pacific was not effected by the pandemic as heavily as other regions last year. (Here is a related news about Hermès in Asia-pacific after coronavirus lockdown) "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion So far we have analyzed Hermès’ revenue by different factors, financial statements, key figures and stock returns. By comparing Hermès’ revenue geographically in 2019 and 2020, we conclude that covid-19 has negatively influenced revenue from all area except Asia at the first half year and recovered gradually in the rest of the year. In 2020, Hermès decreases 500 million Euros compared with revenue in 2019. The revenue from Asia even increased in year 2020. The main consumers in Asia might be from China and Japan by looking at the stare global distribution. However, the growth of revenue in Asia did not completely compensate the decreases in other regions. However, the negative influence on revenue did not affect consumer’s passion to Hermès’s leather products which takes nearly half of the total revenue. Although the Revenue and Recurring operating income decreased in 2020, the workforce of company kept its increasing rate which infered that the growth of Hermès company is not affected by covid-19. Also, Hermès’ total assets and stockholder equity increased in 2020, which shows shareholders’ confidence on Hermès. Although the stock price of Hermès fluctuated with market during the pandemic, it was less volatile compared to other luxury brands’ stocks. Overall, although Hermès’ revenue was impacted by covid-19 in 2020, Hermès remains highly committed and active, and gradually adapts measures to those taken by health and public authorities. This shows a great confidence in Hermès’ future. "]]
